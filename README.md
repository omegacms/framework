The Application package represents the main entry point of the OmegaCMS. It manages the application's
lifecycle, including configuration, routing and handling HTTP requests.

## Requirements

* PHP 8.2 or later

## Installation via Composer

Add `"omegacms/application": "^1.0.0"` to the require block in your `composer.json` file and then run `composer install`.

```json
{
    "require": {
        "omegacms/application": "^1.0.0"
